### Ask a question, give feedback or report a bug
Please [create a new issue](../../issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to respond as soon as I can get to it. if you have any further questions just respond in the thread created and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create the issue and even if it is marked as closed.

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, rather than this project specifically, [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact).

### Read any "closed" bugs or other feedback
Check out the [closed issues](../../issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse issues I've addressed in the past. Feel free to dig
into some of the older threads!

### See all feedback
Open or closed, bug or kind words, you can find it [here](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).

### Make modifications to my source
* On Github

  Make modifications by creating your own GitHub account and then ["forking" this project by clicking here](../../fork). You can let me know about updates and fixes you've created by doing what github calls a [pull request, here](../../compare).  You can check if anyone has requested to [update your fork](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr) with THEIR modifications [here](../../pulls?q=is%3Apr).
* Offline/via e-mail

  You can choose to ["go old school" and just download](../../archive/master.zip), modify and then [send me the modifications via e-mail](../../issues/new), which you can do by [telling me your e-mail address here](../../issues/new). The github system will send me an e-mail, then I'll reply to the address you provide, so you know where to send the files. Of course, for your fork of the project, you can just edit the link that says "send me the modifications via e-mail" with [&lt;your@address.com&gt;](<your@address.com>), remembering to include the less than (&lt;) and greater than (&gt;) symbols around your actual address.

### This "project" is just a skeleton
This project repository was forked from http://github.com/holman/feedback, but that project page had the pesky little problem of using absolute, rather than relative links, making it nigh impossible to port to other users or other projects without significant editing. It also didn't have nearly so many cool, helpful links ;) Basically, I intend to use this page as an outline for a feedback page on all my sub-projects and only have to edit one or two links. I'll try to push it back to the original author's project repository, but there are no guarantees in life.

### Link to other repos by this author
You can direct readers to your page, listing all your repositories by [linking this](../../../), rather than [hardcoding that link](http://github.com/MPagel)
